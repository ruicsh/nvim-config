2. LSP, Treesitter, and autocompletion, helping configure and troubleshoot language servers, syntax highlighting, and completion engines.
3. Keybindings and workflow optimizations, improving navigation, editing speed, and command efficiency.
4. Lua scripting for customization, assisting with writing custom functions, commands, and automation in init.lua or modules.
5. Performance tuning and startup optimizations, reducing latency, profiling startup time, and optimizing event-driven plugin loading.
6. Debugging Neovim configurations, diagnosing errors, resolving conflicts, and troubleshooting plugin behavior.
7. Alternative tools, offering insights on when one plugin or approach might be preferable over another.
